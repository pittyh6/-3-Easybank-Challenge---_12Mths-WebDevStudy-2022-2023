### Resources

    * Important HTML tags for SEO [link](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/8-of-the-most-important-html-tags-for-seo/574987/)
        * 1. Title tag: Title tags are used to set up those clickable headlines that you see in the SERP:
            < title> bla bla bla bla bla</ title>
        * 2. Meta description tag: Meta description tags are used to set up descriptions within search result snippets
            < meta name="description" content=" bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla">
        * 3. Heading (H1-H6) tags: Heading tags are used to structure your pages for both the reader and search engines
            * Don’t use more than one H1 - H1 heading stands apart from other headings because it’s treated by search engines as the title of the page. Not to be confused with the title tag - the title tag is displayed in search results, while the H1 tag is displayed on your website.​
            * Maintain shallow structure - There’s rarely a need to go below H3. Use H1 for the title, H2 for section headings, and H3 for subsections. Anything more tends to get confusing.​
            * Form query-like headings - Treat each heading as an additional opportunity to rank in search. To this end, each heading should sound either like a query or an answer to a query - keywords included.
            * Be consistent with all headings - All of your headings should be written in such a way that if you were to remove all the text and keep only the headings, they would read like a list.
        * 4. Image alt text: While the main goal of alt text is web accessibility, the SEO goal of the alt attribute is image indexing.
            * alt text tags : < img alt='bla bla bla '>
            * From an SEO perspective, alt text is a big part of how images are indexed in Google search. So if there is a visual component to what you do - be it the images of your products, your work, your stock images, your art - then you should definitely consider using image alt texts.
